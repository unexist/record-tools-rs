## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Proposed Solution

Architecture Decision Records as
[described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).
might help us as a format.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records.

## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above.
